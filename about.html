    <div class="aboutSection">

      <div class="aboutBullet"> Introduction </div>
      <div class="aboutDesc-type1"> I'm Vishal Shelake, a twenty year old Freelance iOS Developer from a small city of India called Nashik. </div>
      <div class="aboutDesc-type2"> My interest first provoked when I saw my cousin reading programming books as she was pursuing her engineering exams. She briefly explained me what it all was and since then I fell in love with it </div>

      
      <div class="aboutBullet"> My Journey </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type1"> It all began soon after I realised my interest in computers. </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2"> I requested my cousin to help me enrol in classes where I can
        learn programming so she made me join 'C' language classes. I was just 14 when the process of learning initiated & the more I’d learn the more curious I
        was getting and followed by 'C' I learned Python.<br>
      </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
        Contemporaneously events kept happening that fascinated me more towards knowing more about software related things. One day my father bought an iPhone 4
        and me and my cousins went crazy about the apps and feel of it. Observing all the craziness we were having made me realise that future is going to be
        dominated by these phones and gadgets.
      </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
        Back to learning stage 2, I opted for computer science as my major for class 11th and 12th. While everyone in 12th were decided which college to get in to,
        I was still looking for add on’s to my knowledge. After some research I came across this bootcamp (<a href="https://www.devmountain.com/" target="_blank">DevMountain</a>) in US that teaches you iOS Development and
        being a fanboy of Apple and technology this was a dream come true to learn about it in a proper way.
      </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
        In early 2018 I graduated from DevMountain (<a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/471b9280-a13d-4dff-af32-e2834c305b42/linked_in_profile" target="_blank">View my certificate</a>), and since then I’ve been doing projects as freelancer and working
        for my startup (Read below).
      </div>

      <div class="aboutBullet"> My Startup - Stackinterop (Full-Stack iOS Development) </div>
      <div class="aboutDesc-type1"> After coming back from my bootcamp in United States, I realised that my city is way behind others in terms of technology,
        most of the sectors here are still using tools and softwares that were made 2-3 decades ago & some are still using pen, papers for their daily operations !
      </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2"> Waking up with this fact everyday, I made myself a promise that I would use all my
        knowledge I've acquired throughout to bring as many changes and updates I can for my society.
      </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2"> From past 7-8 months, me and some of my friends are working on a startup called <a href="http://nuclei.000webhostapp.com/" target="_blank">Nuclei</a>, which is a set of 3 Apps working
        synchronously to bring solutions for retail and wholesale businesses.
      </div>

      <div class="aboutDesc-type2">
        Nuclei is my first attempt to bring a technological change in my society and currently we are trying hard to make everyone aware about this.
        Success or failure of Nuclei would never be a measurement for taking more steps forward.
